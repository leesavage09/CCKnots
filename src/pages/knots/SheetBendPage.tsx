            How to tie a sheet bend

          <ul>
            <li>
              Form a bight with the thickest line. If both loops have the same
              diameter, you can choose either line. Hold the bight together in
              your hand, we call this line A.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pull the end of the other line (line B) through the loop, coming
              towards you.
            </li>
            <li>
              Wrap line B under both parts of the bight, formed by line A.
            </li>
            <li>
              Pull the end of line B under itself where it came out of the loop
              originally.
            </li>
            <li>
              To tighten the knot, keep the bight in your one hand. With your
              other hand you pull the end of line B in the opposite direction.
            </li>

            Usage In Sailing

          <Typography variant="body1" component="p" gutterBottom>
            In sailing, the sheet bend knot is mainly used for joining two ropes
            of different thickness together. Although the knot works just as
            well for joining ropes of the same size.

            Structure

          <Typography variant="body1" component="p" gutterBottom>
            The sheet bend is related to the bowline knot. The structure is
            identical, but the sheet bend is used to tie two ropes together and
            the bowline forms a loop.

            Reliability
          </Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1" component="p" gutterBottom>
            When tied correctly, the sheet bend is a secure knot. It is more
            secure than the reef knot. Not under tension, the sheet bend can
            work loose. This also means that it is fairly easy to untie a sheet
            bend when you take off the load.

            Historical facts
          </Typography>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The knot is widely used in textile mills throughout history, hence
              also known as the weaverâ€™s knot. However, weavers tend to tie it
              in a variety of ways.
